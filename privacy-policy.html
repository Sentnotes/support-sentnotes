    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>SentNotes does not sell your personal data. We only share data in limited circumstances:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, subject to strict confidentiality agreements. These include cloud hosting, payment processing, push notifications, analytics, and AI services.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Third-Party Integrations You Enable:</strong> When you choose to connect third-party services (such as Apple HealthKit), data sharing occurs only as necessary to support the connection you activate.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Social Features:</strong> When you connect with other users, they can see your profile information as you have configured in your privacy settings. Messages you send are visible only to the intended recipient(s).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Legal and Safety Obligations:</strong> We may disclose information when legally required or to comply with applicable laws, respond to valid subpoenas, protect rights and safety, or prevent fraud.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> While your account is active</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Wellness Data:</strong> Until deleted by you or upon account deletion</li>

    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sentnotes.com">support@sentnotes.com</a> with "Privacy Request" in the subject line.</p>
    
    <h3>Privacy Settings and Profile Visibility</h3>
    <p>You can control who can see your profile and activity information through privacy settings in the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile Visibility:</strong> This is your master privacy setting. You can set your profile to "Public" (visible to everyone), "Buddies Only" (visible only to your connections), or "Private" (visible only to you).</li>
        <li><strong>Achievements and Badges:</strong> The visibility of your achievements and badges automatically follows your Profile Visibility setting. If your profile is private, achievements and badges are also private.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity Visibility:</strong> When your Profile Visibility is set to "Private" or "Buddies Only", your activity visibility is automatically restricted to match. This prevents contradictory settings where your profile is private but activities are public.</li>
        <li><strong>Route Maps:</strong> Similar to activity visibility, route maps visibility is automatically restricted when your profile is set to "Private" or "Buddies Only".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can adjust these settings at any time in Settings → Profile → Privacy Settings. Changes take effect immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption in transit and at rest</li>
        <li>Secure authentication protocols</li>
        <li>Access controls and regular security audits</li>
        <li>Secure data centers with environmental controls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no system is perfectly secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords and notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized activity.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SentNotes is not intended for users under the age of 16 (or 13 in the United States). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the applicable age limit. If we discover that we have collected information from a child, we will delete it immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>SentNotes uses cloud infrastructure that may process data in various countries. When we transfer your personal information across borders, we implement appropriate safeguards including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Data Processing Agreements, and encryption.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date. For material changes, we will provide notice through in-app notifications or email. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
